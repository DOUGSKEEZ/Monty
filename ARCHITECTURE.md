# Smart Home Control System - Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture of the Smart Home Control System, which is designed to control roller shades and provide weather information.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend Web Application

- **Technology Stack**: React with TypeScript
- **Key Features**:
  - Room-based UI for controlling shades
  - Weather display with current conditions and forecast
  - Settings management
  - Mobile-responsive design

### 2. Backend Server

- **Technology Stack**: Node.js with Express
- **Key Features**:
  - RESTful API for device control and data retrieval
  - WebSocket (Socket.io) for real-time updates
  - Integration with external APIs (OpenWeatherMap)
  - Communication with Arduino for hardware control

### 3. Arduino Controller

- **Hardware**: Arduino with 433 MHz RF transmitter
- **Key Features**:
  - Serial communication with backend server
  - RF code generation and transmission to A-OK motor controllers
  - Status reporting

## Communication Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User interacts with the web interface
2. **API Communication**: Web app makes API calls to the backend server
3. **Hardware Control**: 
   - For shade control: Backend server sends commands to Arduino via serial connection
   - Arduino transmits RF signals to control the motorized shades
4. **Real-time Updates**: Changes in device states are broadcast to all connected clients via Socket.io

## Data Model

### Key Entities

1. **Room**: Represents a physical room in the house
   - Properties: id, name, floor, hasShades

2. **Shade**: Represents a roller shade device
   - Properties: id, roomId, name, position, status, lastUpdated

3. **Weather**: Represents weather data
   - Properties: temperature, conditions, forecast, etc.

## Expandability Path

The architecture is designed to support future expansion:

1. **Native Mobile Apps**: 
   - The RESTful API and WebSocket structure enables easy integration with native iOS and Android apps
   - The data models and business logic can be reused

2. **Remote Access**:
   - Can be enabled via VPN to the local network
   - Alternatively, the backend can be hosted in the cloud with proper security measures

3. **Additional Device Support**:
   - The modular architecture allows adding new device types by:
     - Creating new device controllers
     - Adding corresponding API endpoints
     - Extending the frontend with new device UI components

## Security Considerations

1. **Local Network Operation**: 
   - Initially designed to operate on a secure local network only

2. **For Remote Access**:
   - Implement proper authentication (JWT, OAuth)
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement rate limiting and request validation
   - Consider adding a VPN requirement for remote access
