# Backend API Fix: Route Syntax Error and Missing Dependency

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Route Syntax Error in config.js
- Fixed invalid route path syntax in `config.js` routes
- Changed `'/:path(*)'` to `'/:path'` to fix the `path-to-regexp` parsing error
- This affected both GET and PUT endpoints for config paths
- The error was causing the server to fail to start properly
- The error message was: `TypeError: Unexpected ( at 6, expected END: https://git.new/pathToRegexpError`

### 2. Missing Dependency
- Installed the required `axios` dependency
- Backend server requires axios for the weather service functionality
- Without this dependency, the server would fail to load the weather service

### 3. Previously Fixed: Added Missing Shade Configuration Endpoint
- The shade configuration was not loading in the frontend because the backend was missing the GET `/api/shades/config` endpoint
- This endpoint is required to provide shade configuration data to the frontend
- Added mock data for shade configuration to match the expected UI organization

## Verification
- Confirmed the backend server starts successfully
- Verified API accessibility at:
  - Local: http://localhost:3001/api/health 
  - Network: http://192.168.0.15:3001/api/health

## Issues Observed
- The OpenWeatherMap API shows 401 errors (unauthorized access)
  - This is likely due to an invalid API key or missing configuration
  - This is a separate issue that doesn't affect the server's functionality

## How to Start
The backend server can be started using:

```bash
cd /home/monty/monty/backend
node src/server.js
```

Or using the project scripts:

```bash
cd /home/monty/monty
./restart.sh  # Starts both frontend and backend
```

## Next Steps
1. Configure a valid OpenWeatherMap API key
2. Test the frontend connectivity to the backend
3. Verify all API endpoints are functioning correctly
4. In a production environment, the shade config endpoint would query the SQLite database at `/home/monty/monty/data/shades.db` to get the actual shade configuration
