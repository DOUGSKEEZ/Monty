# Music API Fixes

We've identified and fixed several issues with the Music page and backend API:

## Problems Identified

1. The `/api/music/stations` endpoint was timing out
2. Too many pianobar processes accumulating, causing confusion about player state
3. Conflicting status values: `status: "stopped"` but `isPianobarRunning: true` and `isPlaying: true`

## Fixes Implemented

### Backend fixes:

1. **Improved the `getStations` method** to prevent timeouts:
   - Added a timeout wrapper around the entire function
   - Created a dedicated internal implementation for better isolation
   - Returns mock station data when timeout occurs or errors happen

2. **Fixed pianobar process cleanup** to be more reliable:
   - Added timeout handling for the entire process cleanup operation
   - Runs multiple kill commands in parallel for maximum effectiveness
   - Better error handling and state resetting even when cleanup fails

3. **Enhanced the `getStatus` method**:
   - Added timeout handling for the entire status query
   - Created a dedicated internal implementation
   - Returns consistent fallback data in case of errors or timeouts

4. **Made the `checkPianobarStatus` method more robust**:
   - Added overall timeout handling
   - Better detection of orphaned processes
   - Fixed the threshold for max processes (from 5 to 3)

5. **Improved the `startPianobar` method**:
   - Added timeout for the whole operation
   - More thorough process cleanup before starting
   - Better error handling for Bluetooth connections

### API Route fixes:

1. **Enhanced error handling in music routes**:
   - Added timeouts at the route handler level
   - Always returns 200 status with fallback data instead of errors
   - Better mock data for stations when data can't be fetched

## Testing

After implementing these changes, the Music page should:
1. Load properly without hanging at "Loading music player status..."
2. Show mock station data if real data can't be fetched
3. Have consistent player status display
4. Gracefully handle cases when pianobar processes get into a bad state

## How to Test

1. Open the Music page: http://192.168.0.15:3000/music
2. Verify that the page loads without showing persistent loading messages
3. Check that the player status shows correctly
4. Try using the "Turn On" button to start the player
5. Check if station selection and other controls work properly

If you encounter any issues, please note them down and we can make further improvements.
