## Core Concepts

Monty's backend is built on these core concepts:

1. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Functionality is organized into domain-specific services
2. **Dependency Injection**: Services receive dependencies through constructors
3. **Interface-Based Design**: Services implement well-defined interfaces
4. **RESTful API**: Consistent API design across endpoints
5. **Error Resilience**: Services implement circuit breakers and graceful degradation

## Getting Started

To start working with the Monty backend:

1. Review the [Architecture Documentation](./architecture/)
2. Understand available [Services](./services/)
3. Follow the [Developer Guide](./architecture/developer-guide.md)
4. Use the [API Documentation](./api/) for integrating with the backend

## Contributing

When contributing to the Monty backend:

1. Follow the established architecture and design patterns
2. Ensure services implement appropriate interfaces
3. Write tests for all new functionality
4. Update documentation to reflect changes
5. Follow coding standards and conventions
