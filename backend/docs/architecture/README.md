# Monty Backend Architecture

This directory contains documentation about the architectural design of the Monty backend.

## Architecture Overview

Monty uses a modular, service-oriented architecture with the following key characteristics:

1. **Service-Oriented Design**: Functionality is organized into domain-specific services
2. **Dependency Injection**: Services receive dependencies through constructors
3. **Interface-Based Design**: Services implement well-defined interfaces
4. **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between API, services, and data access
5. **Error Resilience**: Services implement circuit breakers and graceful degradation

## Architectural Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service focuses on a specific domain
2. **Testability**: Code is designed to be easily testable
3. **Modularity**: Components can be reused and composed
4. **Resilience**: System handles failures gracefully
5. **Observability**: Services provide health and status information

## Service Lifecycle

Services follow a consistent lifecycle:

1. **Registration**: Services are registered with the DI container
2. **Initialization**: Services initialize resources and connections
3. **Operation**: Services perform their primary functions
4. **Monitoring**: Services report health and status
5. **Shutdown**: Services release resources gracefully

## Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed through the DI container:

```javascript
// Register service with dependencies
container.register('weatherService', WeatherService, {
  dependencies: ['logger', 'configManager'],
  lifecycle: Lifecycle.SINGLETON
});

// Resolve service (dependencies are automatically resolved)
const weatherService = container.resolve('weatherService');
```

Services receive dependencies through constructor injection:

```javascript
class WeatherService {
  constructor(dependencies = {}) {
    this.logger = dependencies.logger || console;
    this.configManager = dependencies.configManager;
    // Service initialization...
  }
}
```

## Configuration Management

System configuration is managed through the Config Service, which provides:

- Environment-specific configuration
- Runtime settings management
- Feature flagging
- Validation and schema enforcement

## Error Handling

The system implements consistent error handling:

- API routes return standardized error responses
- Services use structured error objects with success/error flags
- Circuit breakers protect against cascading failures
- Graceful degradation when dependencies are unavailable

## Future Directions

Planned architectural improvements include:

1. **Service Health Dashboard**: Visual monitoring of service health
2. **API Gateway**: Centralized request handling and routing
3. **Event-Driven Communication**: Publish/subscribe between services
4. **Metrics Collection**: Performance and usage metrics
