## Testing the System

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/monty/monty/backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/monty/monty/frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the Application:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### Testing Production Deployment

1. Use the provided deployment script:
   ```bash
   /home/monty/monty/config/deploy-production.sh
   ```

2. This will:
   - Install all dependencies
   - Build the frontend for production
   - Set up environment files
   - Install and start systemd services

### Key Features to Test

1. **Shade Control UI**
   - Verify the new organization by room and type
   - Test the controls for individual windows
   - Check the professional SVG icons for UP/STOP/DOWN

2. **Quick Scenes**
   - Verify the explanatory text for each scene
   - Test triggering each scene

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Test system resilience by temporarily disabling network
   - Verify fallback to cached data

## Next Steps

1. **Refinement and Tuning**
   - Collect user feedback on the new UI organization
   - Fine-tune scene timing and behavior

2. **Additional Features**
   - Implement notification system for events
   - Add mobile-responsive design improvements
   - Consider adding a history view for shade operations

3. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Set up a regular log review process
   - Monitor system health over time

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been added:
- System services (`/config/README.md`)
- Error recovery mechanisms (`/config/ERROR_RECOVERY.md`)
- Production deployment instructions

All the work done in Phase 4 focuses on making the system more robust, professional, and production-ready. The UI improvements enhance usability, while the backend changes ensure reliability even under adverse conditions.
