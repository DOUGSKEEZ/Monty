After addressing questions with Claude and performing initial setup of our project directory (and getting a working front-end) , Claude identified the following next steps:

##Next Steps for Monty Home Automation Development

The basic structure is in place! Now we can start building the core functionality. H

Here's the development roadmap I suggest:
